# DOIs retriever for arXiv items in Zotero library

This repository contains a simple script to check within your [Zotero](https://github.com/zotero/zotero) library for arXiv papers without DOI, and look whether they have been updated with a functioning one.

### To do
Make this a Zotero extension. For now: copy-paste it to the console, (**Tools &rarr; Developer &rarr; Run JavaScript** in Zotero).
