# Zotero DOI retriver for arXiv papers

This repository contains a simple extension to check within your [Zotero](https://github.com/zotero/zotero) library for arXiv papers without DOI, and look whether they have been updated with a functioning one.

### To do
Make this a working Zotero extension. For now: copy-paste the content of `chrome/content/retriever-console.js` to the JavaScript console (**Tools &rarr; Developer &rarr; Run JavaScript** in the Zotero menu).
